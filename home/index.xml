      <description>I am a Boya Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, also affiliated with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University.
My research interests fall at the intersection between machine learning and distributed systems, with the aim of developing algorithms that can endow machines with the ability to autonomously acquire the skills to cooperate, communicate, and compete, and building next generation of intelligent systems that can better serve for our daily life.</description>
