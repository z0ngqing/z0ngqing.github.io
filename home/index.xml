      <description>I am a tenured Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at Peking University (PKU).
I am the founder of BeingBeyond, a start-up company on foundation models and embodied AI.
My current research focuses on
 Reinforcement Learning Multimodal Models General Agents  with the aim of endowing robots/agents with the ability to autonomously acquire skills to accomplish tasks, cooperate, and communicate in the open world, towards artificial general intelligence.</description>
