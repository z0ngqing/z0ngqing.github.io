      <description>I am a BOYA Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science, also affiliated with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University.
My current research focuses on
 Reinforcement Learning AI Systems  with the aim of developing learning algorithms that can endow agents with the ability to autonomously acquire the skills to cooperate, communicate, and compete, and building next generation of AI systems that can better serve for our daily life.</description>
