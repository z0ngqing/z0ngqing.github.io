      <description>I am a tenured Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at Peking University (PKU).
I also lead the Multimodal Interaction Research Center at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI).
My current research focuses on
 Reinforcement Learning Multimodal Models General Agents  with the aim of endowing agents with the ability to autonomously acquire skills to accomplish tasks, cooperate, and communicate in the open world, towards artificial general intelligence.</description>
