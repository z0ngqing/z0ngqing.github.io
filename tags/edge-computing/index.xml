      <description>The vast adoption of mobile devices with cameras has greatly assisted in the proliferation of the creation and distribution of videos. Videos, which are a rich source of information, can be exploited for on-demand information retrieval. Deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is state of the art computer vision techniques that can be used for information retrieval. However, due to the high computation of video processing using CNNs, it is not feasible or costs too much to process all videos at a centralized entity, considering a large set of videos which is common in this big data epoch.</description>
