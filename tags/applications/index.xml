      <description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential be applied to many real-world applications. In our research, we also investigate the applications of RL and Multi-agent RL. Currently, we have been investigating two applications: one is traffic signal control; another is EDA. Traffic signals coordinating traffic movements are the key for transportation efficiency. However, conventional traffic signal control that heavily relies on pre-defined rules and assumptions on traffic conditions is far from intelligence.</description>
