      <description>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently attracted much attention from the communities of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems. As an interdisciplinary research field, there are so many unsolved problems, from cooperation to competition, from agent communication to agent modeling, from centralized learning to decentralized learning. MARL has been the main research focus of our lab. We are investigating the field from many perspectives. In the following, we introduce some of our studies.</description>
