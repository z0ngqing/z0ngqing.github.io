      <description>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently attracted much attention from the communities of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems. As an interdisciplinary research field, there are so many unsolved problems, from cooperation to competition, from agent communication to agent modeling, from centralized learning to decentralized learning. MARL has been the main research focus of our lab. We are investigating the field from many perspectives. In the following, we introduce some of our studies.</description>

      <description>Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential be applied to many real-world applications. In our research, we also investigate the applications of RL and Multi-agent RL. Currently, we have been investigating two applications: one is traffic signal control; another is EDA. Traffic signals coordinating traffic movements are the key for transportation efficiency. However, conventional traffic signal control that heavily relies on pre-defined rules and assumptions on traffic conditions is far from intelligence.</description>
